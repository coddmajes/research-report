## Abstract
Sparse coding is an efficient method to represent information, it has achieved widespread applications in image signal processing, 
computer vision and pattern recognition. However, many large-scale practical tasks are still limited by the speed of sparse solvers. 
Data-driven-based sparse coding is an efficient coding strategy that unfolds traditional iterative algorithms into DNNs to speed-up 
the approximation of sparse solutions. Extending from theoretical innovations to application expansions, in more recent years, 
this new sparse coding strategy has achieved great success and received more and more attention. This paper briefly summarizes 
traditional sparse coding algorithms. Next, the paper introduces the classic algorithm LISTA (Learned Iterative Shrinkage Threshold Algorithm), 
gives an outline of the progress of the frontier works out of three aspects: LISTA-based algorithms, theoretical and practical researches, 
and classifies and sums up the main achievements in a structural way. At last, this article discusses the limitations of current works and 
suggests possible future research directions.
